# My First Portfolio Project
## Aim
Day1: 27th December 21, I want to build a simple website from scratch using html,js,css, and python

The purpose of the project is not to build a commercial website. Rather, i aim to understand all the processes that take place to render a website on the internet.

## Some Proposed Features
The simple website will have the following features:
It should be well styled and responsive
It will have a navigation bar, a button, and a form.
The form should take input from the user and repeat it to the user.
For an interesting twist, the website must log what the user 

Everything will be written from scratch including the server, and the logic.



## Perfecting the project
After the project is up and running, i will then use knowledge from books and YouTube to solve certain problems that i may have.
Finally, the app should be functional and hosted.

The final idea of the app is a website that lets a user listen to music hosted on other websites(Evil laugh!!)

## Fledgling Developer days.

Day 2: December 28, 2021, HTML satisfactorily complete. the website welcomes you and tells you to input something. it will then feature a random quote at the bottom(static for now since there is no js). What the user inputs will be repeated to the user.

The next step is adding style. For now, i want to style the header, paragraphs, the input tag(if possible), and the footer. It would be interesting to know general styles and unique styles. In short, i will style every element on the page.

### Styling considerations
I choose a coffee background, with a darker color for the header element and the same for the footer element. 
css complete. Now to add some behavior with Javascript
